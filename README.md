Welcome to my pro bono project. It's a little thing I call Massively Scalable Distributed Open Source Non Profit IoT Backend with JWT to Control Access and Monetize..

This repository is for the code. [The IoT essay is in another repository](https://thei4t.github.io/).

The simple MQTT service is up at knotfree.net port 1883 

To use it you need a 'password' and here is one (the text in red):

<span style="color:red">eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJleHAiOjE2MDk0NjI4MDAsImlzcyI6Ii85c2giLCJqdGkiOiIxMjM0NTYiLCJpbiI6MjAsIm91dCI6MjAsInN1IjoyLCJjbyI6MiwidXJsIjoia25vdGZyZWUubmV0In0.YmKO8U_jKYyZsJo4m4lj0wjP8NJhciY4y3QXt_xlxvnHYznfWI455JJnnPh4HZluGaUcvrNdKAENGh4CfG4tBg</span>

This token is only good for a couple of connections and will expire soon so check back here later for personalized tokens.

See the mqtt example [here](https://github.com/awootton/knotfreeiot/blob/master/clients/mqttclient.py).
