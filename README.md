Welcome to a pro bono science project. It's a Massively Scalable Distributed Open Source Non Profit IoT Backend with JWT to Control Access and Monetize..

This repository is for the code. [The IoT blog is in another repository](https://thei4t.github.io/).

## Note to Developers
* knotfree is a prototype of how a common iot backend could function.
* Some API's may change in the future. 
* There is a live demonstration running. A 'simple MQTT' service is at knotfree.net:1883 To use it you need a 'password' [and you can get one here](http://knotfree.net/). There are Libra Validator nodes running on knotfree.net:8000 for micropayments.

See the mqtt example [here](https://github.com/awootton/knotfreeiot/blob/master/clients/mqttclient.py).
