Welcome to my pro bono science project. It's a little thing I call Massively Scalable Distributed Open Source Non Profit IoT Backend with JWT to Control Access and Monetize..

This repository is for the code. [The IoT essay is in another repository](https://thei4t.github.io/).

The simple MQTT service is up at knotfree.net port 1883  It's ALIVE !!

To use it you need a 'password' (and you can get one here](https://awootton.github.io/knotfreeiot/):

See the mqtt example [here](https://github.com/awootton/knotfreeiot/blob/master/clients/mqttclient.py).

Some docs: (https://awootton.github.io/knotfreeiot/).
