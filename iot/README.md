## The IOT engine

We need a diagram here with the engine in the middle and client 'connections' on the bottom and 'connections' to a 'bridge' above. 

I don't like the word 'connection' and I don't like 'socket so I'll use Contact. As in lower contacts and higher contacts.

At this point there's no TCP so we're using channels of objects.
