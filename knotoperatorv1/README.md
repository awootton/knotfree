# knotoperatorv1

knotoperatorv1n will autoscale the aides and guru's as the number of connections and subscriptions increase. 

## Description

See https://github.com/awootton/knotfreeiot

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### make manifests
 
make manifests 

### Running on the cluster
-1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
atw no, use make deploy xxxxkubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
atw no, use make deploy xxxxkubectl apply -f config/cache.knotfree.net_knotoperators.yaml
```

# 1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=gcr.io/fair-theater-238820/knotoperator
```
	
# 2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=gcr.io/fair-theater-238820/knotoperator
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
